# Idea app

This app is inspired by the Google Keeper. You can write your ideas as
notes in order to have them organised in a nice way.

The app was built using react, where I learnt how to structure the
application using react components, how to use react props in order 
to reuse different modules, how to modify the state of a component 
using react useState and also to add some dependencies for pre-built
front-end components.
